Fight your way up the wooden ramps that twist around the mountains, killing as many of the guards as you can with your spear. Avoid killing any workers caught in the crossfire, and touch them to free them for extra points.<br><br>The construction site is a dangerous place where many have been crushed to death by falling blocks. Sounds of battle are sure to frighten the beasts of burden, so beware of stampedes as well!<br><br>Use the arrow keys to move, and press the space bar to release your spear. Moving sideways while you aim will enable you to attack enemies at various angles. Good Luck!]]></name>		  <name>START PLAYING</name>	  </instruct:Text>		  	  <level:Text>		  <text><![CDATA[FIGHT YOUR WAY TO THE TOP OF THE RAMP!
